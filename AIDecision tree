## this is an example of a behavior tree I read in from a text file. This is "infantry AI" Higher priorities get executed if 
## the condition holds. The parser is not case sensitive but I fell into a habit of capitalizing here.
## note that the highest priority nodes call other decision trees (defense and offense) if there is contact with the enemy.
## if no contact, it does the other lower priority stuff
## I recommend having the lowest priority one always be a random move
